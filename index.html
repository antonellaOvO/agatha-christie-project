         <h3>Agatha, the lady of mystery</h3>
         <p>
          The queen of crime, Agatha Christie is possibly the most famous writer of detective novels and a reference in world literature, with her famous detective Poirot (without ever forgetting her other creation, Miss Marple). Since she was little she already had a great imagination. She had always developed great creativity, and often played with characters she invented herself. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a young woman she also traveled to Egypt, where she became fascinated by all oriental culture (you have the evidence in some novels "Death on the Nile", "Appointment with Death" or "Murder in Mesopotamia"). But, without a doubt, one of the greatest influences she had on her childhood was her work as a nurse. In this work she learned all the secrets of toxicology. In short, Agatha Christie applied this knowledge many times in his novels, in numerous murders.

              The mysterious Mr. Quin
            </h4>
            <p>
              Each chapter or story involves a separate mystery that is solved through the interaction between the characters of Mr Satterthwaite, a socialite, and the eponymous Mr Quin who appears almost magically at the most opportune moments and disappears just as mysteriously.

            <p>
              It’s a very interesting collection of puzzles. Mr. Satterthwaite and Mr. Quin are fascinating characters, and they contribute greatly to the enjoyment of the stories. I would highly recommend THE MYSTERIOUS MR. QUIN as a light read.

            <p>
              It's collection of detective short stories that has a theme connecting the stories, as well, "a group of short detective stories within a detective novel". Tommy and Tuppence Beresford are a a marriage of detectives who met resolving a case. This book it's an adventure series with espionage and humour at its heart.

            <p>
              Tuppence and Tommy Beresford they were never as famous or popular as Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple. But I'm very fond of this detecting duo. In the course of five novels and many short stories in the interim, they got married, had children and continued to investigate even as grandparents.

              <h4>
              Crooked house
            </h4>
            <p>
              A wealthy Greek businessman is found dead at his London home… The Leonides were one big happy family living in a sprawling, ramshackle mansion. That was until the head of the household, Aristide, was murdered with a fatal barbiturate injection. Suspicion naturally falls on the old man’s young widow, fifty years his junior. But there's something else...

            </h5>
            <p>
              The characters are a mixed bag. Crooked House is fuelled by secrets and petty jealousy. The mystery is engaging, with enough suspects and red herrings to try to through even the most hardened of armchair detectives off the trail. The denouement, when it comes, is cleverly dealt with, though the clues are there for the reader to work out who was to blame.
